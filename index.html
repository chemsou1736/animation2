        <h2>this all for you</h2>
        <p>
            In the quiet moments when the world fades away, my thoughts are always of you. The way your eyes light up when you smile, the warmth of your touch, and the sound of your 
            laughter—it all fills my heart with a love so deep that words can hardly describe it. Being with you feels like finding a part of myself that I never knew was missing, and every day with you is a new adventure in a story that I never want to end</p>
   <p>When I think about the future, I see us side by side, building a life filled with shared dreams and countless memories. I imagine us growing old together, our love only deepening
     with time, becoming a testament to everything we've overcome and experienced together. With you, I feel like anything is possible, and the world seems brighter because I know you're in it. You are my safe haven, my closest friend, and the love of my life</p>
<p>Every moment we share, whether big or small, feels like a treasure to me. The simple things—holding your hand, watching the sunset, or even just sitting quietly together—are the memories
     I cherish most. You bring out the best in me, and I find myself striving to be the person you deserve. My love for you is endless, and I am endlessly grateful that we found each other in this vast, unpredictable world</p>
